# Reason for visit
Wife wanted to go camping in the tent while I was trying camping in my minivan.

# Details
Starlink worked pretty good from our spot.  We were in space 53.  I can see where other areas in the campground would not be great though.
One of the camp hosts also had starlink, but hadn't set it up properly, so was broadcasting the STARLINK ssid and it had no password.

Direction: 315 degrees

Mount: Top fo my minivan
